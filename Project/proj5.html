            Thank you so much to all the youth who participated in the celebration of Pride Month dedicated to the LGBTQIA+ community and their allies. Rain or shine, you joined us in walking to promote the so-called “third gender.”
            This event proves that no matter your gender identity, you are valuable and important in this world. Together, let’s fight discrimination against the LGBTQIA+ community and be a voice for those who are afraid to express their true selves because of those who do not understand and continue to discriminate against them.
            <br></br>
            Barangay Lower Bicutan will continue to promote an inclusive community.
            <br></br>
            We would also like to extend our gratitude to Taguig Social Hygiene, SAKLAW President Mx. Erich Fortuna, ELITE Gay Federation Lower Bicutan, and to our kind and hardworking volunteers who helped prepare and make this celebration possible.
            <br></br>
             We hope you enjoyed and appreciated the humble offering of SK Lower Bicutan. Once again, thank you all so much.
             <br></br>
             “Pride is a Protest. It's about claiming who you are and unapologetically owning it.”
