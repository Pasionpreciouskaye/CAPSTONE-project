        <h2>SAGIP KALIKASAN – YOUTH URBAN GARDENING WORKSHOP</h2>
        <p>
            The Sangguniang Kabataan of Lower Bicutan, in partnership with the Taguig City Agriculture Office, held a Youth Urban Gardening Workshop led by SK Chairwoman June Lyn Tabanao and the SK Council.
            <br></br>
            The Sangguniang Kabataan – Lower Bicutan, Taguig sincerely thanks the Taguig City Agriculture Office and our city mayor Mayor Lani Cayetano for their collaboration in making this kind of project possible for the youth of Barangay Lower Bicutan.
            <br></br>
            We also extend our heartfelt gratitude to all the youth who participated in this project — including students from Bicutan Parochial School (BPS), Monlimar Development Academy (MDA), and St. Theodore School Inc. (STS), youth organizations, and our brothers and sisters from the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) community.
            <br></br>
            Once again, our heartfelt thanks to all of you.
