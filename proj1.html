        <h2>SEED TO LEAD – FROM TEAM PLAYER TO VISIONARY LEADER</h2>
        <p>

            The Sangguniang Kabataan of Lower Bicutan, Taguig — led by SK Chairwoman June Lyn Tabanao and the SK Council — successfully held a meaningful training for active youth who aspire to expand their leadership capabilities.
            <br></br>
            The "Seed to Lead – From Team Player to Visionary Leader" is a seminar and training focused on developing the potential and leadership skills of young individuals. The Sangguniang Kabataan of Lower Bicutan expresses its heartfelt gratitude to all the youth who participated, as well as to our Barangay Captain Roel O. Pacayra and the Barangay Council.
            <br></br>
            Programs like this for the youth would not be possible without your support.
            <br></br>
            “A leader who knows how to listen is a leader who knows how to serve.”
