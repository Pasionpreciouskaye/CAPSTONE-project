        <h2> The SEEN IT, CLEAN IT</h2>
        <p>
            Initiative by the Sangguniang Kabataan of Lower Bicutan aims to promote cleanliness and environmental awareness in the community. Through this project, three labeled trash cans--biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable--are provided to every active basketball court in Lower Bicutan. 
            environment for all residents.
            <br></br>
            This marks Day 1 and Day 2 of our distribution of trash bins, “walis tingting” (broomsticks), and dustpans to the designated courts in Barangay Lower Bicutan.
            Together with the Sangguniang Kabataan of Lower Bicutan, led by our SK Chairwoman June Lyn Tabanao and our hardworking SK Council, this program reflects our support for the barangay and the city in maintaining cleanliness and order in our community playgrounds.

            BE MATURE, AND SAVE NATURE.
