            The Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) of Lower Bicutan, Taguig, led by SK Chairwoman June Lyn Tabanao and the Council, successfully held their very first Katipunan ng Kabataan Assembly, which also included a raffle for the youth attendees of this annual event.

           The assembly was attended by various Youth Organizations from Barangay Lower Bicutan. Students from the following schools also participated:

           St. Theodore School (STS), Monlimar Development Academy (MDA), Bicutan Parochial School (BPS), Upper Bicutan National High School (UBNHS), Taguig City University (TCU), Technological University of the Philippines (TUP), Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP)

          — all of whom are residents of our barangay.
          <br></br>

          The Sangguniang Kabataan of Lower Bicutan extends heartfelt thanks to everyone who attended, participated, and listened during our KK Assembly — especially to our guests: Barangay Councilor Goma Cruz, The Barangay Council of Lower Bicutan headed by Kap. Roel Pacayra, Our future Taguig councilor, Kap. Kim Abbang, Our beloved Mayor Lani Cayetano, Our Vice Mayor Arvin Ian Alit.
          This event wouldn’t have been a success without all of you. We hope we were able to present clearly everything we’ve accomplished in our almost one year of service as your youth leaders.
          <br></br>
          The Sangguniang Kabataan of Lower Bicutan looks forward to having you with us again in our upcoming meaningful projects for the youth of Barangay Lower Bicutan.
